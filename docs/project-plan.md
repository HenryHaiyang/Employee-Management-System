# Project Plan

## Project

**Employment Management System**

**Partners:** Henry Guo and Ray  
**Project period:** April 30 to May 5, 2026

## Overall Goal

Create a console-based Java employment management system that demonstrates object-oriented programming while allowing users to manage departments and employees.

## Planned Class Structure

### Employee

An abstract superclass containing common employee information:

- Name
- Employee ID
- Salary
- Annual bonus calculation
- Employee type identification

### FullTimeEmployee

A subclass of `Employee` representing full-time employees.

Planned responsibilities:

- Full-time employee information
- Annual bonus calculation
- Employee benefits

### PartTimeEmployee

A subclass of `Employee` representing part-time employees.

Planned responsibilities:

- Part-time employee information
- Hours worked
- Annual bonus calculation

### Department

Manages an array of employees and provides operations such as:

- Adding employees
- Displaying employees
- Finding employees by ID
- Counting employee types
- Calculating average salary

### Main Program

The main program manages departments and provides the user menu.

## Initial Menu Plan

1. Create new department
2. Add Employee to selected department
3. Display All Employees in selected department
4. Display Full-Time Employees
5. Display Part-Time Employees
6. Calculate Average Salary
7. Update Employee
8. Generate Report
9. Exit

The final implementation expanded this menu to separate the business report and bonus/benefits report and changed the exit option to `0`.

## Division of Work

### Ray

- Employee superclass and subclasses
- Department class
- Fields and constructors
- Employee methods
- Inheritance and encapsulation
- Bonus and benefits functionality

### Henry

- Main program
- Department array
- Menu system
- User interaction
- Employee creation and updating
- Input validation
- Integration and testing

Both partners participated in planning, testing, revisions, documentation, and finalization.

## Project Requirements

The project was intended to demonstrate:

- Classes and objects
- Access modifiers
- Constructors
- Getters and setters
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstract classes and methods
- Arrays of objects
- Searching
- Input validation
- Documentation
- Testing and sample output
